Hunt The Wumpus
=============
Team project for Microsoft Hunt The Wumpus competition 2013. We won one of the runner ups, out of around 40 groups. The state of this repo is preserved in the state that the project was at at the end of the presentations, for history! One day we might all look back on this, and think about how much worse we were at everything back then, that is now, than in the future. So yeah. Keep in mind, the majority of the work was done by two people, in crunch time, two weeks before it was due. So it's probably no small achievment that we won in the first place.
